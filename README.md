## 👨‍💻 Who I am:

I'm a Test Automation Engineer / Software Developer with a passion for test automation, cloud technologies and back-end tools. Currently, I'm working on an e-commerce back-end application, as well as a full-stack Airbnb clone with Next.js 14.

## 🚀 What I'm up to:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Cartify Marketplace - a robust back-end e-commerce application.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js 14 and working on a full-stack Airbnb clone.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of test automation / Node.js projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: Linkedin.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite number is 28, which is a perfect number because it is equal to the sum of its divisors (1, 2, 4, 7, 14).

## 📚 My Values:

- Integrity in everything I do
- Curiosity and continual learning
- Doing stuff outside of the comfort zone
- Positive impact on the community
